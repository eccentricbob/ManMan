# ManMan
Pathfinder Path of War Maneuver Manager

Tool for managing a Pathfinder maneuver class list of maneuvers

Planned features
 * Track known maneuvers for multiple characters, add/remove/change known maneuvers
 * Track current state of prepared maneuvers, prepared/expended/etc. Including current stance.
 * Mystic specific state tracking. Granted maneuvers, random maneuver selection. Possibly animus tracking.
 
Initially planned as a standalone app working off a sqlite database. Potential conversion to a webapp later.
